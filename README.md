# Graph Search Algorithms: Comparative Analysis

## üìñ Project Overview

This project explores and compares three graph search techniques: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and the **A Star Algorithm**. These methods are widely used in computer science to solve complex problems such as games, optimization tasks, and navigation systems. The goal is to evaluate their efficiency in terms of execution time and the number of nodes explored.

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Implementation**: Develop and implement the three algorithms to solve the same problem.  
2. **Performance Comparison**: Analyze and compare the algorithms based on quantitative criteria:
   - **Execution Time**: Measure how long each algorithm takes to find a solution.  
   - **Explored Nodes**: Count the number of nodes visited during the search process.  
3. **Insights**: Identify the strengths and limitations of each method to understand their respective areas of application.

## üí° Key Features

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper.
  - Guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph but can be resource-intensive.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - Explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
  - Uses less memory but may not guarantee the shortest path.

- **A-star-Algorithm**:
  - Combines the benefits of BFS and heuristic-driven search for efficient pathfinding.
  - Balances exploration and optimization using a cost function.

## üîç Comparative Analysis

- **Execution Time**: Evaluate which algorithm is faster for different problem sizes.  
- **Explored Nodes**: Assess the efficiency of each method in terms of resource usage.  
- **Suitability**: Discuss the specific contexts where each algorithm excels.
